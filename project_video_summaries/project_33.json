    "summary": "This research project focuses on applying Bayesian Optimization (BO) to the field of crop genetics, specifically for selecting optimal proxy data to train genomic prediction models. The goal is to identify resilient crops that can withstand factors like pests and climate change. The study uses coheritability as a measure to determine the best proxy traits for desired traits, treating it as a black-box optimization problem.The researchers compared various BO methods using Gaussian Processes (GPs) against random search for four different desired traits. Surprisingly, they found that all BO methods performed similarly to random search. However, a pre-trained probabilistic model with a mixed multitask kernel outperformed standard BO approaches, identifying better proxy data more quickly. The study concludes that Gaussian Processes may not be the optimal choice for this particular problem, challenging the common use of Mat√©rn kernels and GPs as the default in Bayesian Optimization. The researchers also criticize the widespread use of these methods without proper justification. As part of their contribution, the team has released their dataset for further research in this area.",
