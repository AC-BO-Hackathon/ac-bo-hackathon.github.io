    "summary": "This project investigates the application of Bayesian Optimization (BO) techniques directly on molecular fingerprints for drug discovery, focusing on comparing different surrogate models and acquisition functions. The researchers used the LD50 dataset from PTDC with SMILES encodings, which were transformed into ECFP fingerprints, creating a 2048-dimensional feature space. Two surrogate models were examined: Gaussian Processes (GP) and Random Forests (RF).The results showed that in this high-dimensional space, Random Forests with uncertainties evaluated as variance between different trees achieved expected performance across all acquisition functions, significantly outperforming random selection. In contrast, Gaussian Processes failed to perform well, likely due to the challenges posed by the high-dimensional space (2^2048 possible combinations) and the relatively small dataset of only 7,000 data points. The researchers concluded that machine learning models, particularly Random Forests with various acquisition functions, perform well when dealing with high-dimensional molecular fingerprint spaces, demonstrating their potential for drug discovery applications with certain selection biases.",
