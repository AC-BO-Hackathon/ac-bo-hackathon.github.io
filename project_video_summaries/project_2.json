    "summary": "This research project investigates the long-term performance of multifidelity Bayesian optimization (MFBO) methods compared to single-fidelity Bayesian optimization (SFBO) methods. The study focuses on scenarios where two fidelities are available: an accurate but expensive target fidelity that fully represents the objective, and a less accurate but cheaper low fidelity. The researchers observed that while MFBO methods initially outperform SFBO up to a budget of approximately 20, they begin to underperform beyond this point. This behavior is particularly evident with linear kernel MFBO methods, where the performance gap becomes more pronounced after a cost of around 60.The project aims to evaluate the factors contributing to the long-term issues of MFBO methods. Specifically, the researchers plan to investigate the impact of kernel choice, frequency of low fidelity queries, and acquisition function selection on MFBO performance. By analyzing these aspects, the study seeks to identify potential improvements for MFBO methods to enhance their applicability in real-life optimization tasks. The ultimate goal is to develop MFBO approaches that can maintain their performance advantage over SFBO methods in the long run, leveraging the cost-effectiveness of low fidelity queries while achieving superior optimization results.",
