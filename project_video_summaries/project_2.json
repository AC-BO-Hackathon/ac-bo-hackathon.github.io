    "summary": "This project investigates the long-term performance of multifidelity Bayesian optimization (MFB) methods compared to single fidelity Bayesian optimization (SFBO) methods. The study focuses on scenarios where multiple fidelities are available, with one being highly accurate but costly, and the other being less accurate but cheaper. The goal is to leverage these fidelities to achieve optimal performance at a reduced cost. The findings reveal that while MFB methods initially outperform SFBO methods, they fail to maintain this advantage over the long run. Specifically, MFB methods perform better up to a budget of approximately 20, but beyond this point, they are outperformed by SFBO methods. This trend is observed in both linear and down-sampling kernel settings, with the linear kernel showing a more pronounced effect. After a cost of around 60, SFBO methods consistently outperform MFB methods.\n\nThe study highlights a significant limitation of MFB methods in their long-term performance, prompting further investigation into the factors contributing to this issue. The researchers plan to evaluate the impact of kernel choice, the frequency of low-fidelity queries, and the choice of acquisition function to identify potential improvements for MFB methods. The ultimate aim is to enhance the applicability of MFB methods for real-life tasks by addressing these long-term performance challenges.",
