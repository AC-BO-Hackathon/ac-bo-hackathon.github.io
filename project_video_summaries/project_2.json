    "summary": "This project investigates the long-term performance of multifidelity Bayesian optimization (MFB) methods compared to single fidelity Bayesian optimization (SFBO) methods. MFB methods utilize multiple fidelities, where one is highly accurate but expensive, and the others are less accurate but cheaper, to optimize performance while reducing costs. The study examines several MFB algorithms and observes that initially, MFB methods perform better than SFBO, as they can conduct more queries within the same budget. However, beyond a certain budget threshold, MFB methods fail to maintain their advantage and are eventually outperformed by SFBO methods. This trend is observed in both linear KL and down-sampling KL settings, with the linear KL showing a more pronounced effect. The project aims to address these long-term performance issues by evaluating factors such as kernel choice, the frequency of low-fidelity queries, and the choice of acquisition function, with the goal of improving MFB methods for practical applications.",
