    "summary": "The project focuses on a comparative analysis of two Bayesian optimization packages, Dragonfly and BoTorch, to determine which performs better in multi-objective optimization tasks. The study specifically examines the optimization of the Branin-Currin test function with added noise, conducting 20 trials with different random seeds, a batch size of one, and 20 iterations per trial. The results indicate that BoTorch's acquisition functions, particularly the Q noisy expected hypervolume improvement, consistently achieved a lower log hypervolume difference on average compared to Dragonfly's acquisition function. Additionally, BoTorch's acquisition functions produced a more comprehensive Pareto front than Dragonfly, suggesting superior performance in covering the solution space.\n\nThe study acknowledges limitations, such as the use of a fixed batch size of one, which may have influenced the results. Future work is proposed to explore the effects of varying batch sizes, incorporating different input and output constraints, and evaluating the methods on test functions that simulate chemical reactions. This would potentially extend the applicability of the findings to material design problems.",
