    "summary": "The project focuses on a comparative analysis of two Bayesian optimization packages, Dragonfly and BoTorch, specifically in the context of multi-objective optimization. The study aims to determine which package performs better by optimizing the Branin-Currin test function with added noise. The researchers conducted 20 trials of Bayesian optimization using different random seeds, with a batch size of one and 20 iterations per trial. The performance was evaluated using five different acquisition functions, with Dragonfly's acquisition function compared against four computed with BoTorch. The results indicated that the BoTorch acquisition function, specifically the Q noisy expected hypervolume improvement, consistently achieved a lower log hypervolume difference on average across trials. In contrast, Dragonfly's acquisition function struggled to outperform a randomly generated set of candidates and did not cover the Pareto front as effectively as BoTorch's functions.\n\nThe study concludes that BoTorch outperformed Dragonfly in this specific setup. However, the authors acknowledge limitations in their work, particularly the use of a batch size of one, which may have influenced the results. They suggest future research should explore the effects of varying batch sizes, as well as the impact of different input and output constraints. Additionally, they propose evaluating the packages on test functions that simulate chemical reactions to apply the findings to material design problems.",
