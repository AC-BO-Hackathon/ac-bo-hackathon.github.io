    "summary": "This research project focused on developing novel methods for interpreting Bayesian Optimization campaigns by incorporating the temporal component often neglected in end-of-campaign analyses. The study utilized data from a self-driving lab experiment aimed at optimizing the conductivity of a coating. The researchers recreated the Gaussian Process (GP) model employed in the original experiment, training it on subsets of data to simulate mid-campaign conditions. Two primary methods were investigated: First, cross-sections of the GP model were taken at various stages of the campaign, holding all but one feature constant. This approach revealed that closer nozzle distances produced better results, aligning with prior beliefs and serving as a potential mid-campaign sense check to validate model alignment with previous experimentation. The second method involved predicting the error of the next sample based on the model trained on data collected up to that point. This analysis showed that performance improvement plateaued around the time the optimal sample was produced, suggesting its potential use as an early stopping criterion if error is monitored throughout the campaign.The research demonstrates the value of incorporating temporal analysis in Bayesian Optimization campaigns, offering insights that could enhance decision-making during experiments. The cross-sectional approach provides a means to validate model behavior against prior knowledge, while the error prediction method could inform stopping criteria, potentially improving efficiency in optimization processes. These techniques offer promising avenues for real-time interpretation and guidance in Bayesian Optimization experiments, particularly in self-driving lab contexts.",
