    "summary": "The project focuses on enhancing Bayesian optimization runs by addressing the variability in performance that arises from different random seed initializations. The researchers explored the impact of starting Bayesian optimization campaigns with the same initial data points but varying the random seeds, which can lead to significantly different outcomes. Some campaigns may perform poorly by getting stuck in local optima, while others may quickly approach the best possible solution. To mitigate this variability and consistently achieve high-performing campaigns, the team proposed a novel approach. Instead of calculating the acquisition function once, as is standard in Bayesian optimization, they compute it multiple times using various random seeds and select the highest-performing result at each iteration. Although this method requires additional computational effort, the improvement in performance is substantial. The approach allows for the selection of the best-performing campaign from the possible outcomes, effectively avoiding local optima traps.\n\nThe study raises further questions about the trade-off between additional computation time and performance gains, as well as the method's effectiveness across different problem types. The researchers demonstrated the approach on a challenging problem, but its performance on simpler problems remains to be explored. The project is ongoing, and the team invites others to follow their progress and contribute through their GitHub page. The work highlights the potential of using multiple random seed evaluations to enhance the robustness and efficiency of Bayesian optimization processes.",
