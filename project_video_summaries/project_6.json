    "summary": "This research project focuses on applying multi-objective Bayesian optimization to design transparent electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding using thin film structures. The primary objectives are to maximize both transmittance and shielding effectiveness simultaneously. The optimization problem involves selecting materials and thicknesses for each layer of the thin film structure, with a search space comprising 12 material choices and thickness ranges from 5 to 20 nm.The researchers implemented multi-objective Bayesian optimization using random scalarization for the acquisition function. Gaussian process regression and expected improvement were employed as part of the Bayesian optimization framework. The results, presented graphically, demonstrate that the multi-objective Bayesian optimization approach effectively identified the Pareto frontier for the two objectives of transmittance and shielding effectiveness. This suggests that the method is successful in finding optimal trade-offs between transparency and EMI shielding performance for thin film structures, which could have applications in areas such as spacecraft windows where both properties are crucial.",
