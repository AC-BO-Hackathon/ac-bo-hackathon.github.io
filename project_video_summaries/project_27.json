    "summary": "This research project investigated the influence of warm-up sampling methods and dataset sizes on property optimization in low data regimes, specifically focusing on molecular property prediction. The team used the QM9 dataset and selected band gap as the optimization target. They compared two chemically-inspired sampling methods for the warm-up dataset: Morgan fingerprints and MolFormer language model fingerprints.The researchers performed dimensionality reduction on the fingerprints using PCA, projecting them into a 2D space for sampling. They conducted experiments to analyze how the warm-up dataset size affects optimization results. The most significant finding was the comparison between Morgan fingerprints and MolFormer fingerprints at a constant data regime of 50 data points. The results showed that MolFormer fingerprints substantially outperformed Morgan fingerprints, suggesting that pre-trained models on large chemical spaces can potentially improve model optimization rates. This study aims to initiate broader discussions on how dataset sizes and sampling methodologies impact final optimization tasks in molecular property prediction.",
