    "summary": "The study aimed to explore whether Bayesian Optimization (BO) methods could mimic human experimentalists' performance in material science, as humans have been shown to rival BO and outperform random search baselines. The researchers investigated this by examining three axes: model complexity, the number of features, and the acquisition function. They hypothesized that a simple set of parameters, akin to those a human might choose, could be competitive. Specifically, they used automated feature engineering with a linear model for model complexity, three features, and the most exploitative acquisition function to simulate a human experimentalist's approach. The results demonstrated that this \"human\" approach was competitive with random forest models in terms of enhancement and acceleration factors, both outperforming random search. Interestingly, increasing model complexity, feature number, or exploration in the acquisition function led to decreased performance in linear models. The study concluded that low-dimensional, interpretable models could be as effective as traditional BO methods in the tested datasets and hyperparameter settings. Future work includes comparing these results to actual human performance and refining the methodology with advanced techniques.",
