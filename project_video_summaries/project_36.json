    "summary": "This research project focuses on scalable Bayesian optimization in dynamic settings, addressing limitations of previous approaches that rely on myopic acquisition functions and assume fixed cost structures. The researchers introduce a novel method using non-myopic acquisition functions that incorporate a look-ahead mechanism and dynamic cost functions.The project evaluates the proposed algorithm, named HBE, through two main experimental setups. First, they use synthetic functions across 14 different environments with varying dimensions to test scalability. Second, they apply the method to a real-world protein sequence design problem, aiming to maximize a protein score. The researchers compare their HBE algorithm against six other acquisition functions, including state-of-the-art methods. To enhance practicality, they integrate automatic hyperparameter tuning to reduce the number of optimization parameters. While specific results are not provided in the given context, the approach aims to overcome suboptimal resource allocation in dynamic cost experiments and improve upon existing Bayesian optimization techniques.",
