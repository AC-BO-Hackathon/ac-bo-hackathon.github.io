    "summary": "This project focused on exploring multiple context Bayesian optimization using the BAYO code, a Bayesian backend package built on BoTorch with additional features. The primary aim was to investigate transfer learning capabilities by incorporating data from existing campaigns into new optimization tasks.The researchers examined both analytical functions (like the Hartmann 3D function) and real-world data (direct arylation reaction dataset) to assess the effectiveness of transfer learning in Bayesian optimization. They introduced noise, scaling, shifting, and negation to the analytical functions to simulate realistic scenarios. The results demonstrated that using a small percentage (1-25%) of existing data significantly improved optimization performance compared to the baseline without transfer learning. Interestingly, they found that using larger amounts of data (50-100%) did not necessarily lead to better results and in some cases performed worse than the baseline. The team also explored clustering the existing data and using cluster centroids as source data, which proved effective. For the real-world direct arylation dataset, they analyzed correlations between different reaction temperatures and observed that small amounts of transfer data (1-10%) substantially improved the Bayesian optimization campaign. Overall, the project highlighted the potential of transfer learning in Bayesian optimization while emphasizing that careful selection of the amount and type of transfer data is crucial for optimal performance.",
