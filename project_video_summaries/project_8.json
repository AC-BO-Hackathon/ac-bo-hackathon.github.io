    "summary": "This research project investigated the impact of molecular featurization methods on Bayesian optimization performance for guiding molecular experiments. The team explored alternatives to the commonly used connectivity-based fingerprints, aiming to determine which featurization techniques yield the best results in Bayesian optimization for molecular discovery.The study found that without modifying the features, MACCS and RDKit featurization methods outperformed the default options presented in previous publications. To address the high dimensionality of molecular features, the researchers employed specialized Gaussian processes and explored random forest surrogates. However, the random forest approach did not improve performance and required more computational resources. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was successfully used to enable Gaussian processes to handle large molecular featurizations. Notably, physicochemical featurizations like RDKit and Mordred outperformed the previous benchmark winner, MolDQN. The team's findings were consistent with benchmarks in the BO library but suggested that RDKit could produce even better results than Mordred. Overall, the research highlights the importance of careful featurization selection in Bayesian optimization for molecular discovery, with RDKit emerging as a particularly effective option.",
