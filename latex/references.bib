	abstract = {We report the findings of a hackathon focused on exploring the diverse applications of large language models in molecular and materials science.
          , 
            Large-language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 caught the interest of many scientists. Recent studies suggested that these models could be useful in chemistry and materials science. To explore these possibilities, we organized a hackathon. This article chronicles the projects built as part of this hackathon. Participants employed LLMs for various applications, including predicting properties of molecules and materials, designing novel interfaces for tools, extracting knowledge from unstructured data, and developing new educational applications. The diverse topics and the fact that working prototypes could be generated in less than two days highlight that LLMs will profoundly impact the future of our fields. The rich collection of ideas and projects also indicates that the applications of LLMs are not limited to materials science and chemistry but offer potential benefits to a wide range of scientific disciplines.},

	abstract = {The next generation of physical science involves robot scientists - autonomous physical science systems capable of experimental design, execution, and analysis in a closed loop. Such systems have shown real-world success for scientific exploration and discovery, including the first discovery of a best-in-class material. To build and use these systems, the next generation workforce requires expertise in diverse areas including ML, control systems, measurement science, materials synthesis, decision theory, among others. However, education is lagging. Educators need a low-cost, easy-to-use platform to teach the required skills. Industry can also use such a platform for developing and evaluating autonomous physical science methodologies. We present the next generation in science education, a kit for building a low-cost autonomous scientist. The kit was used during two courses at the University of Maryland to teach undergraduate and graduate students autonomous physical science. We discuss its use in the course and its greater capability to teach the dual tasks of autonomous model exploration, optimization, and determination, with an example of autonomous experimental "discovery" of the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.},

	abstract = {Data science is becoming a mainstay in research. Despite this, very few STEM graduates matriculate with basic formal training in programming. The current lesson plan was developed to introduce undergraduates studying chemistry or biology to chemoinformatics and data science in medicinal chemistry. The objective of this lesson plan is to introduce students to common techniques used in analyzing medicinal chemistry data sets, such as visualizing chemical space, filtering to molecules that observe the Lipinski rules of drug-likeness, and principal component analysis. The content provided in this lesson plan is intended to serve as a tutorial-based reference for aspiring researchers. The lesson plan is split into two three-hour class sessions, each with an introductory slide deck, Python notebook consisting of several modules, and lab report template. During this activity, students learned to parse medicinal chemistry data sets with Python, perform simple machine learning analyses, and develop interactive graphs. During each session, students complete the Python notebook protocol and fill out a lab report template after a short lecture. By the end of the lesson plan, students were able to generate and manipulate various plots of chemical space and they reported having increased confidence in their understanding of chemistry, Python, and data science.},

	abstract = {As data science and instrumentation become key practices in common careers ranging from medicine to agriscience, chemistry as a core introductory course must introduce such topics to students early and at an accessible level. Advanced data acquisition and data science generally require expensive precision instrumentation and massive computation, often out-of-reach even for upper-level undergraduate laboratory courses. At the same time, a new generation of affordable do-it-yourself instruments presents an opportunity for incorporation of curricula focused on instrument design and computation into freshman-level courses. We present a new lab for integration into existing courses that starts with hands-on spectrometer building, moves to data collection, and finally introduces an advanced data science technique, singular value decomposition, at an appropriate level with minimal computing requirements. The hardware and software used are modular and inexpensive. The lab was tested in three community college general chemistry sections over two semesters. Previously, students taking these courses did not typically see advanced quantitative chemistry curricula before deciding whether to pursue a bachelor’s degree. This lab allowed students to practice data collection and organization skills, use prewritten Jupyter notebooks that perform advanced data analysis, and gain presentation skills. A multiwave assessment completed by students highlights both successes and difficulties associated with incorporating multiple advanced topics involving instrument design, data collection, and analysis techniques in a single lab.},
