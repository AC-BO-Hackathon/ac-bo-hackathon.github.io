    "summary": "This research introduces a novel approach to Bayesian Optimization (BO) focused on finding general parameters that perform well across multiple related tasks, a common challenge in fields like chemistry where optimal reaction conditions for various substrates are sought. The researchers formulate this problem within the BO framework, aiming to maximize a general response from a set of multiple related objective functions.The proposed algorithm operates in two steps: first selecting a value in the optimization domain X, then choosing an individual objective function to optimize for that value. This approach aims to find the most general values in X without exhaustively evaluating every individual surface, thus minimizing evaluation costs. To support further research in this area, the team adapted popular test surfaces (Dixon-Price, Branin, and Beale) to be compatible with their generality problem and made these benchmark problems available on Hugging Face. This contribution allows other researchers to test and develop new algorithms for generalized Bayesian Optimization, potentially advancing the field and its applications in natural sciences.",
