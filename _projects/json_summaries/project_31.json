    "summary": "This project focuses on utilizing the open-source package AXS for Bayesian optimization in an asynchronous, human-in-the-loop experimental setting, particularly applied to voltammetry. The researchers developed custom figures and explanations to elucidate the complex interactions within the AXS package, emphasizing its user-friendly nature while acknowledging its potential complexity.The study explores various aspects of the optimization process, including strategy selection, surrogate model choice, and search space definition. It demonstrates two primary approaches: a \"cold start\" scenario, where optimization begins with no prior data, and a \"warm start\" scenario for situations with existing experimental data. For the cold start, the researchers showcase the use of sequence generators like Sobol sequences and random generators to initialize the optimization campaign. The project also highlights the package's ability to handle real-world experimental constraints, such as marking broken electrodes to exclude them from future suggestions. In the warm start scenario, the researchers detail the process of translating existing experimental workflows into the AXS framework, emphasizing the package's automatic tracking of experiments, results, and parameters. The study also notes the inclusion of visualization tools within AXS, though these are not described in detail.",
