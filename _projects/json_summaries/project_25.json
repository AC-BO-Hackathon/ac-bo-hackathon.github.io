    "summary": "This project focused on incorporating Bayesian optimization to guide de novo drug design, specifically targeting growth factor receptors for cancer therapeutics. The team built upon the doct string paper, Python library, and dataset by Garcia-Oron and Bacal, using a Gaussian process with a Mat√©rn kernel on Morgan fingerprint representations. They employed a graph genetic algorithm to generate SMILES strings guided by the Bayesian optimization output.The researchers explored both selective and promiscuous binding scenarios. For selective binding, they optimized for binding to FGFR1 while penalizing overbinding to other growth factor receptors relative to their median. For promiscuous binding, they maximized the maximum binding affinity across multiple receptors. They found that a sigmoidal penalty function was more effective than simple absolute differences when optimizing against multiple proteins. The team also incorporated a drug-likeness measure (QED) as a penalty in the optimization process, though its effect was limited. Due to time and resource constraints, the project was unable to extensively explore the chemical space or use more accurate binding affinity calculations beyond docking. The authors suggest that future work could incorporate known unknowns through an evasion process, further optimize selective binding, and compare different molecular representations.",
