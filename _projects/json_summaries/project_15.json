    "summary": "This research project investigates the optimization of batch sizes in BO for chemical reaction yield optimization. The study focuses on determining the optimal batch size (Q) at each step of the BO process, considering both smaller and larger batch sizes. The researchers examine how Q impacts the cost of retraining models, such as large language models, and how it relates to additional experimentation overhead. The project findings indicate that the optimal Q depends on a trade-off between model retraining time and additional experimentation overhead. For a fixed batch size, the researchers observed two minima at Q=3 and Q=7, reflecting the relative importance of Q in different scenarios. With very large batch sizes, the retraining cost had minimal impact on the overall experimental overhead, while experimentation overhead had a significant influence. The study also explored adaptive batch sizing strategies, decreasing batch sizes when performance was good and increasing them as the surrogate model became more trustworthy. The researchers conclude that batch sizes have a crucial effect on BO efficiency in real-world settings, and adaptive batch sizes could effectively balance the trade-off between model retraining and batch sampling effectiveness.",
