    "summary": "This research project focuses on optimizing the selection of Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) for carbon capture applications using BO, specifically Thompson Sampling. MOFs are nanoporous materials with high potential for carbon capture\\cite{furukawa2013chemistry, heo2020metal}, but their synthesis and characterization are expensive and time-consuming\\cite{desantis2017techno}. The goal was to develop an efficient method for identifying high-performing MOF candidates using a small dataset. The team employed a Gaussian Process model trained on the CRAFTED dataset\\cite{oliveira2023crafted}, using both RACs features and geometric features of MOFs, with CO$_2$ uptake as the output. Thompson Sampling was used as the acquisition function to select the next best sample based on the posterior distribution, inherently performing a Bayesian update. The results showed that Thompson Sampling was twice as efficient as random sampling in identifying high-performing MOF candidates. This approach is notable for being the first application of Thompson Sampling to MOF candidate selection, and it requires no hyperparameter tuning, making it easily transferable and cost-efficient. The potential impact of this method is significant, as it could accelerate MOF design for direct air capture applications, with a goal of absorbing 30 million tons of CO$_2$, and could also be applied to post-combustion capture scenarios.",
