    "summary": "This research project focuses on applying multi-objective BO to design transparent electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding using thin film structures\\cite{li2022bayesian}. The primary objectives are to maximize both transmittance and shielding effectiveness simultaneously. The optimization problem involves selecting materials and thicknesses for each layer of the thin film structure, with a search space comprising 12 material choices (Ag, Al, Al$_2$O$_3$, Cr, Ni, Pd, Si$_3$N$_4$, SiO$_2$, Ti, TiN, TiO$_2$, W) and thickness ranges from 5 to 20 nm. The researchers implemented multi-objective BO using random scalarization for the acquisition function via BayesO package\\cite{kim2023bayeso}. Gaussian process regression and expected improvement were employed as part of the BO framework. The results demonstrate that the multi-objective BO approach effectively identified the Pareto frontier for the two objectives of transmittance and shielding effectiveness. This suggests that the method is successful in finding optimal trade-offs between transparency and EMI shielding performance for thin film structures, which could have applications in areas such as spacecraft windows where both properties are crucial.",
