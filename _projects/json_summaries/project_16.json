    "summary": "This research project focused on optimizing the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis process\\cite{mahmoudi2017review}, which converts syngas into biofuel hydrocarbons. The optimization problem on the dataset\\cite{lozano2008single,chakkingal2022multi} involved four input variables (space time, syngas ratio, temperature, and pressure) and four output variables (carbon conversion, selectivity, methane to paraffins, and olefins). The researchers proposed a novel approach using preferential BO\\cite{lin2022preference} with large language models (LLMs) to prioritize outputs based on stakeholder preferences. The methodology employed the typical BO process powered by BoTorch, using Expected Utility as the acquisition function. However, the innovation lay in using an LLM (specifically GPT-4) to perform pairwise comparisons for output prioritization. The results showed that outputs exhibited well-defined optima trade-offs and some degree of monotonicity, which was important for preferential BO. The researchers tested three objective scenarios: optimizing all outputs equally, maximizing only CO conversion, and maximizing three objectives while minimizing olefins. For the first two objectives, the LLM-based preferential BO performed similarly to traditional utility function-based methods. However, for the third, more complex objective, the LLM approach performed worse than the utility function method and only slightly better than random exploration, suggesting limitations in the LLM's ability to handle complex optimization scenarios. The project also included the development of an interactive application for visualizing BO results and running live optimizations.",
