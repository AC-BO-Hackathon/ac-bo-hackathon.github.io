    "summary": "This research project focuses on improving Bayesian Optimization (BO) for high-dimensional, large-scale datasets, specifically applied to the design of Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) for methane storage\\cite{deshwal_bayesian_2021}. The researchers developed a novel approach combining unsupervised clustering with local Gaussian Process (GP) models to enhance BO efficiency in the high data regime. The method begins by using K-means clustering to partition the dataset into distinct clusters. A portion of data from each cluster is then sampled to train separate local GP models. An epsilon-greedy algorithm is employed to determine which GP to train next. The researchers applied this approach to a COF dataset containing over 70,000 2D and 3D structures, assembled in silico from 666 organic linkers and four synthetic routes. The objective was to maximize methane storage performance, measured as deliverable capacity. The results demonstrated that their divide-and-conquer approach with local GP surrogates significantly outperformed a single GP model. While the single GP model reached a maximum deliverable capacity of 2.74 in 60 iterations, the proposed method surpassed this maximum within 5-10 iterations. Both methods retrained the GP model after 20 iterations and used 5% of the data for initial surrogate model training. This research highlights the potential of using local GP surrogates in combination with unsupervised clustering to perform more efficient Bayesian optimization in high-dimensional, large-scale datasets.",
