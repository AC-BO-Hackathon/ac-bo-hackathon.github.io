    "summary": "This research project focused on using ranking models as surrogates in Bayesian optimization for materials discovery, specifically comparing ranking-based and conventional mean squared error (MSE) loss approaches. The key motivation was that in experimental campaigns, finding the best molecule is more important than accurately predicting absolute property values, inspired by work on molecular pool-based active learning\\cite{graff_accelerating_2021}. The study employed a pairwise ranking loss (margin ranking loss) and a simple fully-connected multi-layer perceptron with three hidden layers and 100 nodes as the model architecture. Experiments were conducted on multiple datasets, including a solubility dataset (Delaney) and two datasets from Ali et al. with varying roughness\\cite{aldeghi_roughness_2022}. Results showed that the ranking loss model consistently outperformed the MSE-based model and random baseline in Bayesian optimization, acquiring more top-performing candidates within fewer evaluations. Interestingly, all models performed better on the smoother dataset, contrary to expectations. The study also found that model performance did not always correlate with its effectiveness as a surrogate in Bayesian optimization, as evidenced by the MSE model performing worse than the random baseline on the rougher dataset. The research highlights the potential of ranking-based models in overcoming overfitting issues common in Bayesian optimization with limited data points, particularly in materials discovery applications.",
