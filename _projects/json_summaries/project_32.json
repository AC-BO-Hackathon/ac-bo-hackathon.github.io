    "summary": "This research project explored the application of Bayesian optimization to protein mutagenesis, specifically aiming to optimize protein binding affinity to fentanyl for potential use in biosensors. The team utilized a pre-trained BERT language model, published by Andrew E. Bial, which predicts ligand binding to proteins based on amino acid sequences and SMILES strings. The methodology involved using Bayesian optimization to iteratively select positions and amino acids for mutation, starting with a protein that already had affinity to fentanyl, published by Lisa Mu Banks. The researchers focused on residues within 5 angstroms of the ligand as potential mutation sites.The team compared their Bayesian optimization approach to a baseline using random mutations. They analyzed the resulting mutations using PyRosetta's mutagenesis tool to identify potential new positive interactions and clashes that could alter protein conformation. The structural changes were further investigated using AlphaFold. While the project demonstrated the potential of Bayesian optimization for protein engineering, it was limited by its short two-day duration, suggesting room for further improvements and more extensive analysis.",
