    "summary": "This research project explored modifications to the Bayesian Optimization algorithm to enhance its efficiency in solving real-world problems. The key innovation was changing the order of objective calculation and model fitting. Instead of calculating all objectives first and then modeling each objective, the proposed method only models the essential observations (e.g., yield) and calculates the objectives after the modeling process. This approach was tested using a simulation of a real-world system based on kinetics discovered by Hornel, employing a plug flow reactor. The optimization aimed to maximize both space-time yield and E factor for the predicted yield.The results demonstrated significant time savings by computing objectives after modeling, primarily because only a single model for yield needed to be fitted instead of separate models for space-time yield and E factor. While computational performance improved, there was negligible impact on convergence speed. Interestingly, the research suggests that this new approach might potentially improve the efficiency of selection criteria by allowing the fitting of a prior distribution biased towards regions with more potential based on the objective function's structure. In summary, the study found that fitting objectives after modeling can lead to substantial increases in computational performance, with the possibility of also improving hypervolume convergence efficiency.",
