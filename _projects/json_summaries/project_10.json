    "summary": "This research project explores the application of BO to zeolite synthesis, a complex process with significant industrial importance. Zeolites are crystalline materials composed of interconnected silicate and aluminate tetrahedra, widely used as absorbents and catalysts\\cite{dusselier2018small}. The synthesis of zeolites involves multiple parameters, including silicon and aluminum sources, organic molecules, water, temperature, and time. The process aims to achieve specific properties such as high crystallinity, large external surface area, and particular silicon-to-aluminum ratios, while also considering economic factors like synthesis temperature, duration, and ingredient concentrations\\cite{mallette2024current}. The project presents a GitHub repository containing an introductory text on zeolites and their synthesis, along with a Jupyter notebook demonstrating BO applications. The notebook is divided into two main sections: the first optimizes an analytical dummy function using zeolite synthesis parameters, exploring various aspects of BO including continuous, categorical, and mixed variable types, parameter constraints, and single and multiple objectives. The second section applies BO to propose new experiments based on existing literature data. This approach aims to accelerate the traditionally time-consuming trial-and-error process of zeolite synthesis optimization, potentially reducing costs and improving efficiency in industrial applications.",
