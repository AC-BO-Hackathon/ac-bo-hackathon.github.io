    "summary": "This research presents a novel approach called MOLDES (Molecular Descriptors with Actively Identified Subspaces) for molecular property optimization. The method addresses the challenge of optimizing molecules in high-dimensional spaces by using molecular descriptors - sets of rotationally and translationally invariant calculations performed on molecular graphs - coupled with active subspace identification. MOLDES employs a sparse axis-aligned subspace Gaussian Process prior, which actively learns an encoding while performing Bayesian optimization.The researchers evaluated MOLDES on three case studies: experimental lipophilicity (4,200 compounds), log P optimization benchmark (250,000 molecules), and power conversion efficiency from the Harvard Clean Energy Project (30,000 compounds). In all cases, MOLDES demonstrated superior performance compared to other optimizers, particularly in larger datasets. For the log P optimization, MOLDES consistently found the optimal molecule within 100 iterations. The method also showed strong performance in constrained optimization problems, often achieving the best-case scenario and maintaining a favorable worst-case scenario compared to other methods. Overall, MOLDES proved efficient in identifying high-performing molecules in low-data regimes, offering a promising approach for molecular property optimization tasks.",
