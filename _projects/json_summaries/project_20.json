    "summary": "This research project proposes a self-driving lab approach to optimize hydrogel formulations using BO and automated characterization techniques. The study aims to address the challenge of creating hydrogels with specific properties for applications such as cell culture, tissue engineering, drug delivery, and agriculture. The proposed workflow utilizes an open-source liquid handling robot to mix hydrogel formulations in a 96-well plate, followed by cross-linking using various methods (LED array, heating module, or time). The key innovation is the use of Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS)\\cite{stetefeld2016dynamic} for automated characterization of gelation and viscoelastic properties, which can measure gel stiffness up to 10 kilopascals. This DLS method is implemented using a plate reader specifically designed for 96-well plates, enabling high-throughput analysis. The resulting property data is then fed into a Bayesian Optimizer to determine the next set of formulations and processing parameters to test. This approach aims to efficiently explore the complex relationship between hydrogel formulation parameters and their resulting properties, potentially accelerating the development of custom hydrogels for specific applications in biological research and improving data availability and reliability in the field.",
