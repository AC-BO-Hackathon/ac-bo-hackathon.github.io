    "summary": "This research project focused on using Bayesian Optimization to optimize voltammetry waveforms for sensor performance testing. The researchers employed the scikit-optimize package to implement a human-in-the-loop optimization process, allowing for pauses between optimization iterations to conduct laboratory experiments.The study encoded a four-step pulse waveform into a continuous parameter space for the optimization model. The process began with six randomly generated initial waveforms, which were tested in the lab to obtain performance metrics. These results were used to initialize a Gaussian process model. The optimization then proceeded in batches, with the model suggesting the next best waveforms to test based on previous results. The researchers conducted four total batches, updating the model after each laboratory testing phase. Progress plots were generated to visualize the improvement in sensor error across batches, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach in finding optimal waveform parameters. The study also explored the interactions between model parameters and the performance metric across multiple dimensions, providing insights into the complex relationship between waveform characteristics and sensor performance.",
